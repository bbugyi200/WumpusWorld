##### TODO LIST #####

[X] Alter pProb to account for 1/15 probability of gold
[X] Implement wProb array
[X] Implement gProb array
[] Fix pProb so it scales (55%)
[] Stop cutting off decimals from probs
[] Implement class that handles dependent probabilities. List sharing method has too much overhead.
[] Refactor 'calcProbs' function
[] gProb should change when Wumpus or Pit is known to exist in certain set of squares
[] Make start.py accept function calls
